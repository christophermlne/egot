read github issue 1 and let's get started planning the next
piece of work. when developing, please commit as you go using one line commit messages prefixed by the issue number like `[45]
commit message`. when beginning development, create a new branch
named like `45-branch-name`. when asked to create a pr, the title should be prefixed with the issue number like `[45] pr title`. '45' is just the example issue number, you'll need to replace it with the actual issue number. ok, let's start planning.
